#This program calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order to pay off a credit card balance 
#within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment,we mean a single number which does not change each month,
#but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month.
#The program should print out one line: the lowest monthly payment that will pay off all debt in under 1 year
#for example: Lowest Payment: 180 
#This problem was part of the MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python edx course
